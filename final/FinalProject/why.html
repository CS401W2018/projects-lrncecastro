            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Hi , I'm glad that you are able to find my website. My name is Lau and I'm from the Philippines where people there adopts other people's culture as long as they seem to like it, I'm one of them. I started to love watching anime since I was little, anime before weren't that very nice when it comes to drawings, animations, and effects, the graphics weren't that good but I still watched them because of some reasons. Since, I was young I knew that many of  the animes came from Japan, and I can vividly remember that for me to see animes before I had to go to my neighbour and watch with them because we didn't have Television. To cut this little background about myself, I'd like to write a couple of things I keep watching anime even I am already an adult.</p>

                <h2 class="h2">Anime is an Entertainment</h2>
                <p>Since, I was little I found anime as a very nice entertainment where I feel like I'm part of something I am watching. And there are so many genres that you can select to watch anime.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="flex">
                <h2 class="h2">Storylines</h2>
                <p>Storyline is also one of reasons why I am still watching anime even if I am already an adult. The stories of these anime are very interesting, the plot twist they put and details that you have to pay attention is you will be able to better understand the story.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="flex">
                <h2 class="h2">Characteristics of the characters</h2>
                <p>When watching an anime sometimes you will just find yourself thinking if you know a person that its just like that anime that you are watching. Sometimes you will just think that it's kind of acting like you. This kind of anime are very interesting to watch.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="flex">
                <h2 class="h2">Anime is also a from of an Art</h2>
                <p>I've seen anime evolved. From drawings and very poor color codings I could say that anime is becoming an art these days. Specially when they put so much animation to the anime and when the graphics almost cross the line of excellency, this kind of art is really something.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="flex">
                <h2 class="h2">Anime Provides Moral Lessons</h2>
                <p>Just like what I medntioned above the storylines of each anime you are watching is very interesting where sometimes you can also learn something from it. And one of my favorite qoute from the anime is the one that <em>Lee</em> mentioned, he is a character from <em>Naruto Shipuden</em> he said <em>"Hardwork beats natural talent."</em>. I took this advice so seriously where I always do my best everything I do because I know I'm not the kind of a person to have lots of talents so I need to work hard just to get the things I need.</p>
