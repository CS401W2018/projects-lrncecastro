        <h2>Anime</h2>
        <p>I was born way back 1998 when animes and cartoons are so popular. I remember that I had to to my neighbhour's house just to see a cartoon or anime episode because we didin't have TV. I also recalled that I used stay in their house to watch them, so, watching <span class ="anime">anime</span> even at this time is still some thing I can't give up. I learned from them and I enjoyed watching them. In fact I am able to learn a couple of Japanese words by just watching it.</p>
        <h2>Video Games</h2>
        <p>Technology is growing so fast, and I can still vividly remember that I learned playing <span class = "videogame">videos games</span> when I was around 7 years old and since then I keep on playing a lot of different videos game. I don't know if it's already considered as an addiction but I couldn't help myself not to play a video game in a day, any game, as long as a game that I think I would enjoy.</p>
