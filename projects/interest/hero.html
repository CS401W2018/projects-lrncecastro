        <h2>Alma</h2>
        <p>I chose Alma as my hero not because he is prophet but because he said something that is very important for me. I came from a poor household where seeing my parents struggle to find money just to provide for our daily needs. And when I thought of doing something so I could help my parents I read something that Alma said in The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ, he said, <mark><em>"By small and simple things are great things brought to pass."</em></mark>. Upon reading I had an idea what I should be doing during those time. I thought that I don't have to be rich, great, and smart kid to be able to help my parents. But what I should be doing are some things that are small but do them in a great way.</p>
