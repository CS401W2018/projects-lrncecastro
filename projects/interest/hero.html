        <h2>Alma</h2>
        <p>I chose Alma as my hero not because he is prophet but because he said something that is very important for me. I came from a poor household where seeing my parents struggle to find money just to provide for our daily needs. And when I thought of doing something so I could help my parents I read something that Alma said in The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ, he said, <mark><em>"By small and simple things are great things brought to pass."</em></mark>. Upon reading I had an idea what I should be doing during those time. I thought that I don't have to be rich, great, and smart kid to be able to help my parents. But what I should be doing are some things that are small but do them in a great way.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt><h4>Courageous</h4></dt>
            <dd>Alma was a priest in King Noah's court (Mosiah 17) and being a priest in the King's court is a very big thing back in the days. And the reason why I put Courageous is that even if he had this one big job he decided to leave it to pursue his faith and do what is right in the eyes of the Lord. I know some of us may be blinded if we are offered great things. But Alma knew that doing the Lord's desire was the most important.</dd>
            <h4><dt>Faithful</dt></h4>
            <dd>Alma is one of the faithful character in the Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ. He's faithful because after Abinadi, <em>a prophet</em>, testified about the Savior he believed it. And after he believed he acted. That's what should faith mean to all of us. We believe, and we act in accordance to God's will.</dd>
            <h4><dt>Strong</dt></h4>
            <dd>For me Alma is also a strong person. He's not only strong in appearance but in many areas too. Something that helped me be the person I am now today. I know I'm not perfect but I think I can do things that I think is good because I'm trying to be strong in all areas of my life.</dd>
