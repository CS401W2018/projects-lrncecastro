    <h1>Laurence Castro</h1>
    <p>Hey! my name is Laurence or you can call me Lau if you think that's easier. I was born and raised in the Philippines. Since this is a profile page I would like to share a little bit about my interests. Growing up I've become fond of watching anime. I've seen lots and lots of anime and sometimes even if I already watched that particular anime I would watch it again because I enjoyed watching it.</p>

    <p>Playing video games as well has grown onto me. I started playing video games when I was 8 and I remember that I had to go to someone's house to rent their machines to play games. So, with that in mind I told myself that in the future I will build my own machine to play games whenever and wherever I want. It took me 16 years to build my own computer but what I can say is that I'm satisfied to what I did. I can now play videos games, watch anime, and do a lot of things with my computer.</p>
