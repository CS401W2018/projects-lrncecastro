            <p><em>Reincarnated as a Slime</em> started with the protagonist named Satoru Mikami. He is a middle age man that worked as a <em>General Contractor</em> then due to an accident he got reincarnated in a different world where magic, demihumans, and devils exist. During the time he was laying down he thought a lot of things that resulted his form to be a slime.</p>
            <p>Waking up in a different world as a slime he found himself inside of a cave where the Legendary Storm - Veldora was sealed. These 2 individuals became good friends which in the later episodes of the anime they fight enemys hand in hand.</p>
            <p>As of the moment Rimuru Tempest is the worlds strongest anime have been ever created.</p>
