        <h1>CSS Selector</h1>

        <h2>List out the different ways to select an item.</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Tag selector</li>
            <li>ID selector</li>
            <li>Class selector</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>What is the difference between an ID and a Class?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li id = "firstpar">ID follow a process such as you have to identify where you want to put the id in a tag, for example, &lt;p id  = "..."&gt;. And by putting #name in the css file you can change color etc. of what you are working on.</li>
            <li class = "blue">Class can be used in wide variety. It the same with the ID you have to put the class inside of the tag, for example, &lt;li class = "blue"&gt;, there you can work on that specific part of it, but remember that in css you have to use .name of your class and the one that you want to do with it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is the difference between a SPAN tag and a DIV tag?</h2>
        <p><strong><span style="color:rgb(128, 128, 2)">Span</span></strong> is a kind of element and with it you can work on a specific <span style="color:red">word</span> in a paragraph. In addition &lt;span&gt; doesn't create anymore spaces.</p>
        <p><strong><mark>DIV</mark></strong> is default block element same with header, main, and footer, however, &lt;div&gt; takes the available space, for <div>example, if I wrote something</div> like this only the part that is inside of this is <div>cut out.</div></p>
        <h2>What is the difference between a DIV tag and a HEADER, MAIN, or FOOTER?</h2>
        <h4>DIV</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Takes all available space</li>
            <li>It can be a container to group words</li>
            <li>Doesn't provide any semantic meaning itself.</li>
        </ul>
