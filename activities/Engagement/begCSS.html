        <h2>Explain the difference between inline, embedded, and external CSS.</h2>
        
        <p>Inline CSS is the one we apply directly with the tag, and this only applies in that specific tag. For example if we use the &lt;p&gt; we have to put something inside, such as style = ".."</p>
        <p>Embedded CSS is the one that has a style attribute but it is outside of the tag, rather we create something outside of the tag. For example we will use &lt;style&gt; &lt;/style&gt; and inside of it we put our code for instance <mark><strong>p</strong></mark> for the paragraph followed by the &lbrace; color = "blue" &rcub; </p>
        <p>External CSS is the one that we use to access the other file that we created in the same folder that we have but this one has the extension of <mark><strong>.css</strong></mark> we use &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="name of the file"&gt; so we can combine them in one html.</p>
        <h2>Explain why you should only use external CSS.</h2>
        <p>From what I understood because sometimes employer hires different kinds of programmer who focuses on just doing the website and the other is just focusing on doing the design of the website. Also for me I think it's easier to make edits if we use external CSS. </p>
        <h2>What is a selector used for?</h2>
        <p style = "color: black">We use <mark><strong>selector</strong></mark> so we can focus on something we are working on. For example I can change the color of the font of this specific paragraph to black because I inserted the style attribute inside and it is only selecting this part of the paragraph.</p>
