        <h3>What is unique about the PNG format?</h3>
        <p>Looking at PNG and JPEG photos actually doesn't show any big differences. But my observation is that PNG is more quality than JPEG.</p>
        <h3>How do you resize your photo to the size it should be displayed?</h3>
        <p>There many ways to resize the photo. One, by using some tools that can resize a photo.And second, is when using CSS you can resize the photo if the img is with a class tag.</p>
        <h3>Why should you resize photos using photo editing software instead of resizing it using CSS? </h3>
        <p>If we resize the photo before bringing it to the html, the photo size (mb) will also lessen, and the quality of the picture will still be the same.</p>
