        <h3>What is normal flow in HTML?</h3>
        <p>Normal flow is that each block tag takes the entire space of the screen.</p>
        <h3>What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</h3>
        <p>Float can put the image or something from left to right or vice versa. And you can remove the float by making any block tag. For example the &lt;p&gt; tag and create a class inside of that tag use the "clear" and type "both"</p>
        <h3>What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</h3>
        <p><mark><strong>Absolute</strong></mark> position removes the flow on the screen or browser, where after the one you are working on will stay still on the position, different to the relative position.</p>
        <p><mark><strong></strong>Fixed</mark> position just like the word suggest the element that has this one will be fixed in that position.</p>
        <p><mark><strong>Relative</strong></mark> position allows you to work on different positions on the screen by adding an x of pixels in top, left, right and bottom, and by so doing the one you are working on can sometimes go overlapping the other things you have on the browser if browser size has been changed.</p>
        <h3>How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?</h3>
        <p>We can make a nice navigation buttons for mobile devices by changing where the navigation is, changing its color, making it look that the navigation changes into something when it's click.</p>
        <h3>Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class?</h3>
        <p>Log in to canvas > find the class > click home > scroll down until you find "Lecture Notes = CSS and Box model".</p>
